# WordHat: Behat for WordPress

---

:warning: **This is a work-in-progress fork of the original WordHat library which is no longer maintained. It is not currently stable**. It may or may not replace the original WordHat project, I've yet to discuss this with Paul Wong-Gibbs, the original WordHat maintainer.
